# License FAQ

## Source code license

The source code is licensed under [PolyForm
Shield](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/). PolyForm Shield is a standard
source-available license adopted by many companies. Broadly, this license allows the code to be used
for any purpose other than competing with bitdrift.

## What does competition mean in the context of Shield

The Shield license is extremely broad in its definition of competition. As the licensor, bitdrift
offers the following high level guidance on what we view as non-competitive and competitive.

### Non-competitive

* As an **end user**, using and modifying the proxy for any purpose.
* As an **end user**, developing a private control plane to serve proxy APIs including sampling,
  allowlist control, blocklist control, dynamic configuration of the proxy configuration, etc.

### Competitive

* Bundling the proxy and selling it, either as part of a larger SaaS, or offering enterprise support
  for the bundled code.
* Implementing a control plane that targets proxy APIs and selling that control plane as a service.
* Implementing a control plane that targets proxy APIs and releasing that control plane as OSS.
